# Project Name & Pitch

Digi Coin

An application that digitizes America's piggy bank by making the transfer of change easy and completely digital, built with Ionic React. Merchants can add money to their account using cash/card. To transfer change to customers, merchants can scan their barcode or enter their account number. Customers can also withdraw the change they've collected by transferring the money to their bank account, redeeming it for a gift card, or donating it to a charity. 

# Project Status

This project currently runs all within the browser as it is a front end application. A backend database integration is needed to store the merchant and customers' data. The barcode scanner also needs to be implemented using the QuaggaJS library.
